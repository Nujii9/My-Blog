Historical Perspective on Computing
Ancient Foundations to Mechanical Era
Early tools like the abacus (c. 2400 BCE) were used for arithmetic. In the 17th century, Pascal and Leibniz developed mechanical calculators. Babbage’s Analytical Engine (1830s) is seen as the first computer, and Ada Lovelace became the first programmer.

Early Digital Computing
Alan Turing's 1930s concepts laid computing's foundations. Zuse built the Z3 (1941), and ENIAC (1945) was a major breakthrough. The von Neumann architecture (1940s) shaped modern computer designs.

The Microprocessor Revolution
The 1970s saw Intel’s 4004 (1971), sparking personal computing. Companies like Apple and Microsoft dominated the 1980s with user-friendly PCs.

The Internet and Digital Age
Evolving from ARPANET (1960s), the internet became global by the 1990s. The World Wide Web transformed access to information, while mobile and cloud computing continue to revolutionize industries.

Latest Innovations
Quantum computing is emerging to solve complex problems beyond classical computers' capabilities.

Impact on Society
Computing has transformed communication, business, healthcare, and education but also raises concerns about cybersecurity, privacy, and the digital divide.

Introduction to IT Basics
Hardware
Hardware: Physical components like the CPU (processes data), RAM (temporary storage), and storage devices (permanent data storage). Peripherals like keyboards and monitors allow user interaction.

Software
Programs and OS. Operating systems (e.g., Windows, macOS) manage hardware, while applications (e.g., browsers, word processors) perform specific tasks.

Networking
LAN connects computers in local areas, and WAN spans wider regions like the internet. Routers direct traffic between networks, while IP addresses identify devices.

The Role of IT in Modern Organizations
IT ensures data management, seamless communication, process automation, and cybersecurity. It supports decision-making through data analysis tools.
