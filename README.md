        <h1>Historical Perspective on Computing</h1>
        <div class="description">
            <h3>Ancient Foundations to Mechanical Era</h3>
            <p>Early tools like the abacus (c. 2400 BCE) were used for arithmetic. In the 17th century, Pascal and Leibniz developed mechanical calculators. Babbage’s Analytical Engine (1830s) is seen as the first computer, and Ada Lovelace became the first programmer.

        <div class="description">
            <h3>The Internet and Digital Age</h3>
            <p> Evolving from ARPANET (1960s), the internet became global by the 1990s. The World Wide Web transformed access to information, while mobile and cloud computing continue to revolutionize industries.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="description">
            <h3>Latest Innovations</h3>
            <p>Quantum computing is emerging to solve complex problems beyond classical computers' capabilities.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="description">
            <h3>Impact on Society</h3>
            <p>Computing has transformed communication, business, healthcare, and education but also raises concerns about cybersecurity, privacy, and the digital divide.</p>

        <h1>Introduction to IT Basics</h1>
        <div class="description">
            <h3>Hardware</h3>
            <p>Physical components like the CPU (processes data), RAM (temporary storage), and storage devices (permanent data storage). Peripherals like keyboards and monitors allow user interaction.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="description">
            <h3>Software</h3>
            <p>Programs and OS. Operating systems (e.g., Windows, macOS) manage hardware, while applications (e.g., browsers, word processors) perform specific tasks.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="description">
            <h3>Networking</h3>
            <p>LAN connects computers in local areas, and WAN spans wider regions like the internet. Routers direct traffic between networks, while IP addresses identify devices.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="description">
            <h3>The Role of IT in Modern Organizations</h3>
            <p>IT ensures data management, seamless communication, process automation, and cybersecurity. It supports decision-making through data analysis tools.</p>
